# Get-Video-Length
Simple script that returns movie names and their length, ordered by their length in ascending order. Made it for my needs, may be useful to someone else as well.

In order to run this script you need to have MoviePy installed. https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/install.html

Cheers.
